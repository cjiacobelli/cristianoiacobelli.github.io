								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>This past summer (2020) I worked as an engineering intern for INTGR8 Technologies. One of the things I did for them was work on android studio code that takes data from map SDK’s and began to integrate the MapBox Vision SDK into it as well.  This helped me improve my Java, Kotlin and XML skills as well as taught me to parse large HTML code files.</p>
								<h2>The Project</h2>
								<p>The goal of the project was to create an app that could establish speed limits by reading the road signs via its camera and if there weren’t any signs, it would be able to use its GPS and internet connection to call a speed limit using a map SDK.  Finding the speed limit through a map SDK was completed by first, accessing the device’s coordinates.  The speed limit layer of the map was then found by using a link that led to HTML code, which had to be parsed to access information such as the street name and speed limits.
									<br /><br />The MapBox vision SDK aspect of the project was not completed in the time I was working on it.  It was partially working as the camera would turn on however, I ran out of time to fix the error in the setup that would allow it to recognize hazards and read road signs. The error seemed to be due to compatibility issues with the device I was using.  None of the code is available for viewing as it is private in GitHub.
