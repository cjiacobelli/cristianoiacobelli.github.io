								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>In second semester of second year, this was a semester long project that I completed with the help of three other group members.  The goal was to design an emergency system for a high-rise building, capable of sustaining life for up to five days without access to external resources.  This project helped us develop our skills in problem scoping, creativity, idea generation, engineering ethics, and decision making incorporating technical, economic, societal, and environmental factors, safety, engineering codes and regulations.</p>

								<h2>The Project</h2>
								<p>When a natural disaster creates a situation that
									prevents a high-rise building from having electricity or an abundance of food and water, it can be life
									threatening to the occupants of the building. In order to
									sustain livable conditions in a high-rise building, the occupants must have access to food, potable
									water, a waste removal system (i.e. toilets), and basic medical supplies.<br /><br />
									For water there are multiple different storage options including tanks, jugs, or sealed water bottles.
									Each one has different advantages. After scoring each option, sealed water bottles are shown to be the
									most viable options.<br /><br />
									For the decision regarding nutrition, various food groups were compared against several criteria
									including cultural and dietary acceptance, preparation difficulty and lifespan. Dry Cereal was the most
									successful with dried fruit, legumes, nuts and grains having similar final scores.<br /><br />
									For heating and cooling, the solution proposed was meant to be the most energy efficient and
									environmentally friendly. The comfort of the residents, amount of fuel and cost was considered. After
									doing research, Geothermal heat pumps was the main solution considered as it can provide heating and
									cooling and uses renewable options. Wall cladding and double-panel windows were also considered. The
									best option was to combine all the solutions together allowing for maximum efficiency and economical
									feasibility.<br /><br />
									For the electricity source, several options were considered. Fossil fuel generators
									and backup batteries were found to be the two most viable options. Those two categories were
									narrowed down to batteries connected to solar panels, and natural gas generators, which were
									compared using a table, outlining their pros and cons. Batteries connected to solar panels
									were found to be the ideal option.</p>
