								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>In the Fall semester of 2018, this was a semester long project that I completed with the help of three other group members. There were two parts to this project.  One was to determine the ideal route for a hyperloop anywhere in the world based on what we deemed to be important factors.  The other was to build a small, working hyperloop model with a motor as the only given component. This project helped me develop our skills in problem scoping, creativity, idea generation, engineering ethics, and decision making incorporating technical, economic, societal, and environmental factors, safety, engineering codes and regulations.</p>

											The ideal location for the Hyperloop was determined to be between New Delhi and Mumbai.  Given the route fits all the requirements and constraints prescribed by QLoop as well as those given by SpaceX and identified by the team, it is a suitable choice. With 130 daily flights between Mumbai and New Delhi and 23 million train users in the country everyday (see full document for sources), the densely populated centres ensure that there will be a high demand for the transportation system. Furthermore, this energy efficient transportation alternative could significantly decrease India’s carbon footprint and improve their quality of air. The project is predicted to generate a financial return within 15 years, with resource life at 50 years, therefore generating USD$11.2 billion before materials need to be replaced. On top of this, modelling has shown that social and environmental benefits could save India up to USD$430 billion. 
											<br /><br />Although there are disadvantages like the potential increase in disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as destruction to the environment, these disadvantages are minute in comparison to the potential benefits. The Hyperloop offers improvement to the quality of life of citizens, air quality, increased employment opportunity, and substantial economic growth, suggesting that it would be a viable location for a Hyperloop.
											<br /><br />For the second portion of the project, the hyperloop model was created.  The model can be described using three different categories: propulsion, levitation, and chassis systems.  The propulsion system used was a belt system comprised of a rubber band that connected the motor shaft to the rear axle, which turned the rear wheels and propelled the vehicle. Next, the levitation system used was a wheel-based system. This was a simple system that relied on two axles and three wheels to “levitate” (was initially going to use magnets but didn’t have any powerful enough).  Finally, the chassis system used primarily consisted of a thin cardboard base with another cardboard platform for the second tier. The overall shell of the vehicle was constructed from recycled plastic to imitate the ideal aerodynamic shape of the Hyperloop.  Photos of the finished model were lost, however the image below details what the model looked like.
