								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>This past summer, during quarantine, I decided to learn how to make apps in android studio using online resources. My goal was to learn to create an app similar to Instagram. Once I completed the app, I was proficient in coding in Kotlin, some Java and xml.  As well, I learned how to use Google Firebase as the backend of the app to store all the data.</p>
							
								<h2>The App</h2>
								<p>
									The app I created has many of the same features as the current popular social media platforms. For every created account there are options to recover a forgotten password through a verified email, change password and change username. As well, accounts can add the links to their other social medias. Other features include uploading, deleting and reporting posts as well as being able to change your post's caption.
									<br /><br />There are four main pages once logged in; explore, top posts, profile and settings.  Explore calls two unique randomized posts (that are not your own) that are then voted on using the buttons at the bottom.  Once a vote is made, the upvote is added to one of the posts and it refreshes to new randomized posts.  The top posts page is an infinite scroll that displays every post based on its amount of upvotes.  The profile page shows all of your posts and has options for you to delete and edit your posts.  The settings page allows you to change your username and password and logout.  As well, there is a new post page where you create and upload your posts.
									<br /><br />The video below demonstartes the app's capabilities.</p>
